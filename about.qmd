The Ness of Brodgar is a prehistoric archaeological site located on an isthmus in Orkney's West Mainland, Scotland. It is a part of the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site. The name stems from Old Norse and roughly translates to the "headland of the bridge farm."

The site is known for its extensive discoveries of Neolithic structures, pottery, bones, and stone tools. The Ness of Brodgar sits in a vast "cauldron" ringed by hills, presumably aligned naturally to the midwinter rising sun and midsummer sunset, making it ideal for viewing. The area is surrounded by numerous iconic prehistoric landmarks like the Ring of Brodgar and the Stones of Stenness.

## Ness of Brodgar is publicly funded

The Ness of Brodgar excavation project relies heavily on public donations for its operation. Contrary to widespread belief, the project is not funded by business or sizeable government grants. In fact, public donations contribute to almost 80% of the project's funding, particularly during the summer dig season.

The duration of the excavation season at the Ness of Brodgar is dictated by the availability of funding, not by factors like weather, personnel limitations, or site access.

Fundraising is a continuous process due to the high costs associated with running an excavation of this magnitude. Despite the participation of volunteers and students from around the world and in-kind support, operating a dig season, including post-excavation activities, costs over £200,000 every year.

For those interested in supporting the project, the website provides several ways to do so, including sponsorship programs, donations, or purchasing items from their online shop.
